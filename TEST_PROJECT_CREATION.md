## 🚀 How to Test Project Creation

### Step 1: Access the Application
1. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:4000`
2. **Verify the server is running** (you should see the eng.com homepage)

### Step 2: Sign In with Test Account
Since authentication is required, use one of these test accounts:

**Option A: Test Account**
- **Email:** `test@eng.com`
- **Password:** `password123` (or create via signup)

**Option B: Demo Account**  
- **Email:** `demo@eng.com`
- **Password:** `password123` (or create via signup)

**Option C: Create New Account**
- Go to `/signup` and create a new account
- Complete the profile setup

### Step 3: Navigate to Project Creation
1. **Sign in** with one of the test accounts
2. **Click "Projects"** in the navigation menu
3. **Click "New Project"** or "Create Project" button

### Step 4: Upload a Project
Fill out the project creation form:

**Required Fields:**
- **Title:** `My Test Engineering Project`
- **Description:** `Testing the project upload functionality`
- **Discipline:** Select `Mechanical Engineering` (or any discipline)
- **Files:** Upload at least one file (PDF, image, or any engineering file)

**Optional Fields:**
- **Tags:** `["test", "engineering", "demo"]`
- **License:** `MIT` (default)
- **Public/Private:** Keep as Public for testing

### Step 5: Submit and Verify
1. **Click "Publish" or "Create Project"**
2. **Wait for upload** (should not show demo mode message anymore!)
3. **Verify success** - you should be redirected to the project page
4. **Check project feed** - go to `/projects` to see your project listed

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators
- **No "demo mode" message** - Projects are created for real
- **Project appears in feed** - Visible in `/projects` page
- **Files are uploaded** - Stored in Supabase Storage
- **Project has unique URL** - `/projects/[username]/[project-slug]`
- **Database record created** - Real data, not mock

### ❌ Failure Indicators (Should NOT happen anymore)
- ~~"Note: This is running in demo mode" message~~
- ~~"Project created with mock data" alert~~
- ~~Project not appearing in feed~~
- ~~ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED errors~~

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Server Won't Start
```bash
# Kill any processes on port 4000
lsof -ti:4000 | xargs kill -9

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### If Authentication Fails
1. **Check database** - Ensure Supabase is running
2. **Try signup** - Create a new account instead
3. **Clear browser data** - Clear cookies/localStorage
4. **Check console** - Look for JavaScript errors

### If Project Creation Fails
1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Verify authentication** - Make sure you're signed in
3. **Try smaller files** - Start with a simple text file
4. **Check network tab** - Look for API request failures
